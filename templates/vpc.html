      <h2 class="subtitle">
        Virtual Pet Calendar is a web application that allows users to keep
        track of their pet's health and happiness. Users can create a pet, feed
        it, play with it, and take it to the vet. The pet's health and happiness
        levels are displayed on a calendar, and users can see how their pet is
        doing at a glance. The application uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
        Firebase for the backend.

        <h1 class="title">Problem Space</h1>
        <p>
          In today's fast-paced world, many individuals struggle with staying
          motivated and maintaining productivity. Traditional calendar and task
          management apps, while effective, often lack engagement and a sense of
          obligation, making it easy for users to ignore or procrastinate on
          their responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Virtual Pet Calendar was designed to gamify productivity by
          integrating task management with an interactive virtual pet. The pet’s
          well-being depends on the user’s ability to complete scheduled tasks
          and manage their time effectively. By creating a playful and rewarding
          system, this project aimed to bridge the gap between responsibility
          and motivation, encouraging users to stay consistent with their
          schedules in a fun, engaging way.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project space sits at the intersection of productivity tools,
          behavioral psychology, and gamification, leveraging technology to
          transform habit-building into an enjoyable and interactive experience.
