        <h2 class="subtitle">
            Virtual Pet Calendar is a web application that allows users to
            keep track of their pet's health and happiness. Users can create
            a pet, feed it, play with it, and take it to the vet. The pet's
            health and happiness levels are displayed on a calendar, and users
            can see how their pet is doing at a glance. The application uses
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase for the backend.

            <p>
                In today's fast-paced world, many individuals struggle with staying motivated and maintaining productivity. 
                Traditional calendar and task management apps, while effective, 
                often lack engagement and a sense of obligation, 
                making it easy for users to ignore or procrastinate on their responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Virtual Pet Calendar was designed to gamify productivity by 
                integrating task management with an interactive virtual pet. 
                The pet’s well-being depends on the user’s ability to complete 
                scheduled tasks and manage their time effectively. 
                By creating a playful and rewarding system, 
                this project aimed to bridge the gap between responsibility and motivation, 
                encouraging users to stay consistent with their schedules in a fun, engaging way.

                This project space sits at the intersection of productivity tools, 
                behavioral psychology, and gamification, leveraging technology 
                to transform habit-building into an enjoyable and interactive experience.
