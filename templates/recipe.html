        <p>
          In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, many people struggle with meal planning,
          food waste, and making the most of the ingredients they have on hand.
          Home cooks often find themselves with mismatched ingredients and no
          clear idea of what to cook, leading to unnecessary grocery trips or
          wasted food. Additionally, traditional recipe search methods can be
          time-consuming, requiring users to sift through multiple recipes that
          may not match their available ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recipe Wizard addresses these challenges by leveraging AI to generate
          creative, personalized recipes based on whatever ingredients users
          have. By providing instant, customized meal ideas, the app helps
          reduce food waste, save time, and inspire home cooks to try new dishes
          effortlessly.
